Function Keys:
--------------
F2 - Saves Frame Animation - One Frame of the entire scene
F3 - Saves Animation trigger for the current frame.
     The Animation saved in the trigger will correspond to the frame the Animation is on.
     Example: If Mecha Ziu's Animation Frame is 3, the forward animation will be saved in 		the trigger.

		display on frame two.
